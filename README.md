``` # Node.js Realtime Welcome to the Node.js Realtime repository! This project demonstrates how to implement real-time features using Node.js, enabling seamless and interactive experiences for users.

## Features - **Real-time Communication**: Utilizes WebSockets or other technologies for live updates and interactions.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Provides instant feedback and updates without needing to refresh the page.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle multiple concurrent users efficiently.
